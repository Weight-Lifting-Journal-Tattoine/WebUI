<!-- Hey Brandon, on Wednesday evening we started the UI work, focusing on HTML first.
Samet created the index.html page, I then utilized his code to create the producs.html page.
The contact.html page is your responsibility.
Our idea is to include the following:
1. contact form so that a new or current customer can get in touch with us.
2. information about the team members who are working on this project.
Let's talk when you're back, so we can figure out how you feel about this work and whether we should seprate out some of it into a new page. -->
