                    <br /><br />
                    With our state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we'll help you calibrate your workout
                    outputs, and help plan future programming.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>After less than a few weeks of data input, and with the help of our professional bodybuilders and
                    weightlifters on staff, ProLift will generate your programming to match your weightlifting goals.
                    <br /><br />
                    We will show you three options of goals to strive for, and set you on track to muscle building
                    success. ProLift will recalibrate every four weeks to make sure our program and your goals are
                    aligned.</p>
